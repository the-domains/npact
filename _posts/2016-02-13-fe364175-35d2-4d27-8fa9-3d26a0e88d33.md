## OUR MISSION

Our mission here at Npact is to reduce global greenhouse emissions by making it simple for people to understand their personal energy use and take real action to reduce it. We work under the assumption that there are many competing priorities in your life and so we do everything possible to make this commitment as easy and rewarding as possible.
